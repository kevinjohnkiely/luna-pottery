# Luna Pottery - Project 5

<!-- Screenshot image goes here -->

Luna Pottery is an e-commerce online store application built with Django and Python. It allows users to create their own accounts, and experience a full online shopping experience whereby they can purchase items of ceramics and pottery. The application is intended as a template for all small-to-medium arts and crafts people to use to drive sales of their products and to better market their output using a modern, functional web storefront. The application also provides customer engagement by allowing the user to rate or review the products they have purchased.

# UX (User Experience)

## Target Audience
The target audience for this application are lovers of arts and crafts, in particular people who love ceramics and pottery. This target persona will also engage with the application by providing feedback on the ceramic products on offer. This audience may also include those who wish to learn how to create their own pottery by way of the pottery classes that can be booked using the web storefront.

## User Stories
There are 2 classifications of user that can use this site, the Customer and the Administrator. The Customer can carry out all expected tasks of a modern web storefront such as purchashing, adding items to cart, reviewing items and placing them on a wishlist. The Administrator is concerned with adding the store products to the store, with all the required details and data.

## Wireframes

# System Design
Once the system requirements from the Site Users perspective was finalized, a design of information flow was completed to demonstrate how the required data models were needed for the backend of this application. The following entity relationship (ER) diagram displays the relationship between the various data models.
